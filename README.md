# snap-temp-sensor

This is a small Ubuntu Snap to use as a template/demo.

The snap contains a small Python app which simulates a temperature sensor via MQTT. Currently the Snap configuration snap/snapcraft.yaml is prepared for using the Snap on Ubuntu Core (arm64), which can be easily changed into another architecture.
